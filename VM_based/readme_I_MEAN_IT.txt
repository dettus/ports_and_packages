This is my latest approach to ports and packages: 
Install 4 virtual machines, and perform all the testing inside.

The Installation process is MANUAL. Meaning, that the default iso images are
being used. The installation itself needs a little bit of manual labour. 


PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY!!
