Okay, I can to that. Already did that, in fact. No problem!
However, I was assuming that then somebody else has to take this bug report, check it, upload it to the subversion server... I my mind that was quite a nuisance for you guys, and I was looking for a solution that was a little more streamlined than that.

However, I saw that you added a "TIMESTAMP" to the distinfo. What is that, exactly?
